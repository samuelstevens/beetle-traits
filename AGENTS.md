- Use `uv run SCRIPT.py` or `uv run python ARGS` to run python instead of Just plain `python`.
- After making edits, run `uvx ruff format --preview .` to format the file, then run `uvx ruff check --fix .` to lint, then run `uvx ty check FILEPATH` to type check (`ty` is prerelease software, and typechecking often will have false positives). Only do this if you think you're finished, or if you can't figure out a bug. Maybe linting will make it obvious. Don't fix linting or typing errors in files you haven't modified.
- Prefer negative if statements in combination with early returns/continues. Rather than nesting multiple positive if statements, just check if a condition is False, then return/continue in a loop. This reduces indentation.
- This project uses Python 3.12. You can use `dict`, `list`, `tuple` instead of the imports from `typing`. You can use `| None` instead of `Optional`.
- This project decorates functions and classes with `@beartype.beartype` to do run-time checking of types. If a function is extremely simple, don't worry about it.
- Tensor/array variables are suffixed with _[letters], where [letters] are individual letters representing dimensions. For instance, an activation tensor `x_hat` that represents P patches, each with dimension D, would be written as `x_hat_pd`.
